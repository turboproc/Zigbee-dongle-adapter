# Introduction

The Zigbee dongle adapter allows for easy connection of the [Zigbee USB dongle] (https://github.com/turboproc/Zigbee-USB-dongle) to the 
TI CC-DEVPACK-DEBUG debugger. This way the Zigbee USB dongle can be programmed through the CJTAG interface.

**WARNING: this is work in progress. Designs still need to be validaded on first prototypes.**
